It's a website for virtual crowd funding community. Any one can make donations to various campaigns through the website. <br>

CrowdFund Connect is a frontend-only crowdfunding platform built with React. Users can 
browse, filter, and donate to funding campaigns using a virtual coin system. Donations and 
coins are handled locally using React state/context, and all campaign data is stored in a 
local JSON file (no backend or API).
